KEY TAKEAWAYS
========================================

When DCA Outperforms Lump Sum:
"1. Market declines after initial investment date"
"2. Highly volatile sideways markets"
"3. Long-term bear markets with eventual recovery"
"4. When investor timing is poor (buying at peaks)"

When Lump Sum Outperforms DCA:
"1. Uptrending markets (historically ~67% of the time)"
"2. When market rises consistently from investment start"
"3. Bull markets with low volatility"
"4. When capital has opportunity cost (sitting in cash loses to inflation)"

Psychological Benefits of DCA:
"1. Reduces anxiety about market timing"
"2. Creates disciplined investment habit"
"3. Easier to start with smaller amounts"
"4. Averaging reduces impact of buying at a peak"

QQC.TO Specific Notes:
"- This is a NASDAQ 100 covered call ETF providing monthly income"
"- Current yield: ~8-10% from covered call premium income"
"- More defensive than pure QQQ due to covered call strategy"
"- Suitable for income-focused investors who want tech exposure"
